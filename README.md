## Computer Vision Powered Image Search Application

**object detection and visual search application** built using **YOLO** and **Streamlit**.  
The system detects objects in images, stores structured metadata, and allows users to **search images by object type and count** through an interactive web interface.

##  Project Overview

Searching large image datasets manually is inefficient.  
This project solves that problem by:

- Automatically detecting objects in images
- Extracting and storing detection metadata
- Enabling fast, flexible image search using object filters
- Visualizing results with annotated bounding boxes

The application supports **single-image inference**, **batch processing of image folders**, and **metadata reuse** without re-running inference.
